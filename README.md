iOS DFP Banner Example
======================
A simple example built on top of Google's official DFPExample project. Dynamic loading of banner ad, with the button clearing it out and reloading the ad again.

Run this in profiler to see leaks and allocations which hang around for the lifetime of the app.

Sample profile after clicking the button a few times:
